# Javascript Projects

A Javascript project may me either an actual project on its own or a sub folder of a non js project.

When I ask to start a js project I typically want the following setup:

- Vite / Vitetest
- Prettier
- Typescript support
- Linting
- Vanilla JS support
- Stylus support for css

Unless I specify I dont want React or Tailwind.

If I ask for things like Vue or Web Components please set them up to work with the above bullet points.
