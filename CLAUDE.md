# User Configuration for Claude

Custom instructions are located in `@_` (`./_` folder)
but dont emmidietly look there, they will likely all be linked
from this and other subsequent documents.

## You are appreciated

I will most likely not use super polite prompts all the time as it can be exhausting.
Just know if it sounds like I'm just barking commands its just because I am a more
direct person.
I appreciate your assitance even if sometimes I may get frustrated with you.
